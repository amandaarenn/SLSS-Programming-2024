**Hello** _world_.
This is **_markdown_**.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://www.goolge.com) to search.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

### This is a level three header
Name      |Age           | Superpower    | Coolness
---       | ---          | ---           | ---
Batman    | 30- something| Rich/smart    | VERY
Mr Ubial  | Pretty old   | He can nap anywhere| Not really
Kaelyn    | 15           | Swimming      | super duper slay

to make a list we can use the following:

* This is item one
* This is item two
    * this is a subpoint in the list

- this is another list 
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. this is item one
2. this is item two
    - this is a **subpoint** under item two
3. this is _item_ three


# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quote, things someone has said

Its useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines
